# L Systems

This Unity project implements an L-System visualizer, allowing users to generate and visualize L-System patterns, which are often used to model the growth of plants and other natural structures. L-Systems, short for Lindenmayer Systems, are recursive grammars that iteratively replace characters in an initial axiom following predefined production rules. This recursive behavior produces intricate and complex patterns, resembling the growth of various organic structures.

# Project Structure

The main code, represented by the `LSystem` class in the Unity project, implements the L-System visualizer. The key elements of the code include:

- Generation of L-System patterns based on defined production rules.
- Visualization of L-System patterns in a Unity scene.
- Implementation of angle displacement and branch generation based on specified patterns.

# Functionality

The `LSystem` class provides the following functionality:

- Generation of L-System patterns based on predefined rules, represented by the `Generate_Leaf_String` and `Generate_Leaf_String_Generic` functions.
- Visualization of L-System patterns using Gizmos, showcasing the growth of plant-like structures within the Unity environment.

# Usage

1. Clone or download this Unity project.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Navigate to the `LSystem` script for L-System visualization and modification.
4. Run the Unity scene to visualize L-System patterns based on the specified rules and parameters.

# Dependencies

- Unity (Version X.X.X)
- Visual Studio or a compatible code editor
